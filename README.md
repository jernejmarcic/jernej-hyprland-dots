# My Hyprland dotfliles
Here are all my hyprland dotfiles as of now, I plan to upgrade them soon and make them more dynamic (pywal colors, etc).
Some of the scripts and stuff don't work and/or I found a better way to do them and I still haven't bothered to remove them.

A lot of the configuration I "borrowed" from other people, I plan on properly crediting them in the configs and on this README soon.
